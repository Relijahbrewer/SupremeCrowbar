                    <p>Our design artists work tirelessly to bring you fresh, clean new designs every month. We've set up a gallery to showcase their work! Some designs youve seen on your clothes, some you may even own! But some were scrapped or set aside. Here you can see those and vote which ones you like the most so that we can better decide which ones to take another look at.</p>
