                    <p> "The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears
                        And rescues them from all their troubles.
                        The Lord is near to the brokenhearted
                        And saves those who are crushed in spirit.
                        The afflictions of the righteous are many,
                        But the Lord rescues him from them all.
                        He protects all his bones,
                        Not one of them is broken."</p>
